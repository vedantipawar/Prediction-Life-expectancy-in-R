INTRODUCTION
Government policymakers and planners around the world use population projections to gauge future demand for food, water, energy, and services, and to forecast future demographic characteristics. Population projections can alert policymakers to major trends that may affect economic development and help policymakers craft policies that can be adapted for various projection scenarios. The accuracy of population projections has been attracting more attention, driven by concerns about the possible long-term effects of aging, HIV/AIDS, and other demographic trends along with the effect of Covid-19 around the globe. Not only would it give an insight into the changes in population due to health concerns but also migration due to resources and better lifestyle quality by comparing population predictions of different countries.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Building a prediction model using machine learning to find the mortality rate in the next fifty years and analysing the contributing factors that affect the change in population demographically using the dataset provided by WHO
TECHNOLOGIES USED: R programming language.
APPROACH:
Step1: Building a model using various libraries and forecast model in R.
Step2: Training and testing the data on WHO dataset
Step3: Finding the Accuracy using confusion matrix and plotting the results.
 
Time Line : Data collection : 3-4 days
	          Creating Algorithm:  5 days
	          Implementation : 1 day
